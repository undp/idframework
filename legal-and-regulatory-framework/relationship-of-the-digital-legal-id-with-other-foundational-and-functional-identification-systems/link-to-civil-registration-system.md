# Link to civil registration system

## Anchor Question

In case the digital legal identity system being considered is not itself a digitalised civil registration system, is it linked to and designed to support civil registration? For example, if a person lacks a birth certificate or other civil registration certificate is there a system to ensure that enrolment in the digital legal ID register is also an opportunity to ensure late registration of birth?

## Rights Implications

Civil registration, in particular birth registration, establishes the elements of a personâ€™s identity that are necessary to establish rights based on family relationships, including care and custody of children, inheritance of property, nationality, and legal residence. Every child has the right to birth registration; and if this was not carried out at birth, late registration should be facilitated.

## Example Scenarios

If enrolment in a digital legal identity system is mandatory, it should be possible to enrol for those without the requisite feeder documents. However, the procedures for enrolment should include the possibility of ensuring late birth registration for free (or fee-waiver for those who have financial challenges) or issue of other relevant documents.

## International Standards

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Article 24 and Convention on the Rights of the Child Articles 7 and 8, and other treaties provide for the right to birth registration.SDG Target 16.9: Provide proof of legal identity, including birth registration.UN Legal Identity Agenda: [https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda](https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda)

Legal identity is defined as the basic characteristics of an individual's identity: for example, the name, sex, place and date of birth conferred through registration and the issuance of a certificate by an authorised civil registration authority following birth of an individual. In the absence of birth registration, legal identity may be conferred by a legally-recognised identification authority. This system should be linked to the civil registration system to ensure a holistic approach to legal identity from birth to death.
