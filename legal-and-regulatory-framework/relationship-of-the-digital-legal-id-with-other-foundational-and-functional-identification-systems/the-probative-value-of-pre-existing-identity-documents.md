# The probative value of pre-existing identity documents

## Anchor Question

Does a credential issued by a previous legal identification system (digital or not) prove the elements of identity it records for the purposes of enrolment in the digital legal ID system?

## Rights Implications

If existing documents are downgraded in probative value for enrolment in the new system, risks of exclusion are increased. Comprehensive and clear rules on the status of existing documents help to prevent arbitrary decision making and ensure consistency of records between different registers.

## Example Scenarios

A (non-digital) official document that was in the past accepted as proof of the elements of recroded legal identity should be considered prima facie proof of the same status when the system is digitised, especially during the transitional period. (That is, it can be overturned, but only after following due process of law, and after production of substantive evidence that, for example, it was fraudulently acquired).
