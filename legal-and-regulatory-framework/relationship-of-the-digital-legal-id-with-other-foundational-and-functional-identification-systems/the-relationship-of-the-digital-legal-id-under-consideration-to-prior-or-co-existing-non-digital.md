# The relationship of the digital legal ID under consideration to prior, or co-existing (non-digital)

## Anchor Question

Does the law clearly establish how the digital legal ID system under consideration relates to the other elements of the ecosystem for legal identity (digital or not), and establish the forms of existing ID that are required to enrol in the digital legal ID system?(These could include, according to context, birth notifications, baptismal certificates, civil registration certificates, national identity cards, refugee ID documents, voter registration cards, ration books, health care identity documents, certificates issued by local or customary authorities, or any other official document).

## Rights Implications

Clarity in the relationship between different elements of the legal identity ecosystem makes the requirements for identification easier for those enrolling to understand, and reduces the possibility of arbitrary decision-making. In particular, the discretion to require additional proof of identity from some applicants may enable discrimination in application of the law.

## Example Scenarios

The relationship of the digital legal ID system to other elements of the legal identity system is clearly established in law, including the ‘feeder documents’ that are required to enrol in the digital legal identity register. The same requirements should apply to any applicant, without discrimination.
