# The existence of legally established procedures for the implementation of the digital legal ID sys..

## Anchor Question

Does secondary legislation (for example a regulation /decree) clearly establish procedures for the implementation of the primary legislation, such as requirements for enrolment, forms to be completed, processing of data or the format for the issuing of credentials? If not, what elements are missing or not public?

## Rights Implications

The existence of public and legally binding procedures for implementation of digital legal ID enables those enrolling to understand their rights and obligations and minimises risks of arbitrary decision-making.

## Example Scenarios

Secondary legislation clearly establishes procedural rules for implementation of the primary law. Guidance that is not public (internal departmental circulars etc.) should be restricted to purely administrative questions that are not relevant to those enrolling in the system.
