# The existence of legal authority for the digital legal ID system under consideration

## Anchor Question

Is there a valid enacted law backing the digital legal ID system? Does this law clearly establish:

a) the elements of legal identity recorded by the identification system (for example: name; sex; date and place of birth; identity of parents; nationality or legal residence in the country);

b) (where relevant) the different statuses that the ID may record and the requirements to be enrolled with any particular status;

c) authority for the digitalisation of the identity system. If not, what elements are missing?

## Rights Implications

Those eligible or required to enrol in the digital legal ID are able to know and understand their obligations and rights when all the elements of the identity system are established in law.

## Example Scenarios

A single law (primary legislation adopted by the legislature) or a combination of multiple laws establishe(s) legal authority both (a) for all the elements of legal identity recorded by the identification system under consideration and the different statuses that may be recorded (if relevant), and (b) for the identification system to be digitised (including recording of biometric elements, where that is in place).
