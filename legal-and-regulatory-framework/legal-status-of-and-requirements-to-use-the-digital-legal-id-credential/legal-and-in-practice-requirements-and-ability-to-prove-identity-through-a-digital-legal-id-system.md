# Legal and in practice requirements and ability to prove identity through a digital legal ID system

## Anchor Question #1

Is enrolment in the digital legal ID mandatory in law or required in practice for all citizens and /or all residents to access the rights associated with that ID?

### Rights Implications

Even if there are multiple (digital) IDs, inclusion /exclusion from that ID has a direct impact on associated rights and obligations. The introduction of mandatory digital ID use for accessing public services should be assessed with high levels of scrutiny, considering, among other factors, ID population adoption, the risk to vulnerable communities, and necessity within the specific use case.

### Example Scenarios

Where possible, introducing a digital ID should not narrow the identity options available to citizens. Citizens should retain the option to use existing identification credentials already in their possession.

### International standards

UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs statistics in 'Guidelines on the Legislative Framework for Civil Registration, Vital Statistics and Identity Management Systems' (2023): [https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/Standards-and-Methods/files/Handbooks/crvs/CRVS\_GOLF\_Final-E.pdf](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/Standards-and-Methods/files/Handbooks/crvs/CRVS\_GOLF\_Final-E.pdf)



## Anchor Question #2

Is the digital legal ID legally required to be accepted as authoritative proof of the elements of legal identity it records for transactions with both the public and private sector?

### Rights Implications

If the digital legal identity is sufficient proof of the elements of identity it records, access to rights and services by those enrolled is facilitated.  If a digital legal identity is not formally proof of the elements of legal identity it records, then there is the risk of discrimination and exclusion in case of accessing rights and services or renewal of the credential.

### Example Scenarios

If a person is enrolled in the digital legal ID system, credentials issued by the system should be established as legal proof of the elements of identity recorded, by both the public and private sector, in accordance with the law: additional forms of proof of identity should not be required (even if they are accepted as alternatives).

### International standards

There are no international standards that specifically address this.
