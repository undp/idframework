# Data protection impact assessment

## Anchor Question

Has a data protection impact assessment been conducted (and if so, at what stage of the system development)?

## Rights Implications

A data protection impact assessment is a process designed to describe the processing of data, assess its necessity and proportionality, and help manage risks.

## Example Scenarios

The data protection impact assessment describes the proposed processing operation and the purpose of processing. It reflects an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operation against its stated purpose, and an assessment of the possible risks to rights and freedoms of data subjects, and proposed security measures to address these risks.
