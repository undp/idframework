# Cyber security impact assessment

## Anchor Question

Has a risk assessment been conducted by experts? What are the recourse mechanisms in the case of a potential cyber attack?

## Rights Implications

There is an imminent risk of cyber threats by malicious actors. Sensitive personal data being breached or leaked can lead to adverse scenarios. Especially when there is a dependency on digital IDs to access public services.

## Example Scenarios

The cyber security impact assessment is conducted prior to the launch of the digital ID system. If the risk is identified, the budget to take appropriate measures is allocated and such measures are implemented based on the international standards and best practices.
