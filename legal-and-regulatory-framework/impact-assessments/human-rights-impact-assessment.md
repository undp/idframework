# Human rights impact assessment

## Anchor Question #1

Has a human rights impact assessment been conducted (and if so, at what stage of the system development)?

### Rights Implications

If a human rights impact assessment is conducted it can help identify and mitigate risk and harm.

### Example Scenarios

A human rights impact assessment is conducted at early stage of system conception, inline with international best practice, with findings feeding into system development; Human rights impact assessmens are repeated at regular intervals on the implementation of the system in practice.User study to be conducted every year to understand edge cases and scenarios in which the required set of documents are not feasible for all. Alternate processes to be created and current documents not to be made mandatory for all.

## Anchor Question #2

What reports are there of discrimination and exclusion of individuals or groups from existing identification systems? (e.g., digital and non-digital, including birth registration, national ID cards, voter registration, and any other document required to access rights and services).

### Rights Implications

If existing patterns of technology and identification related discrimination are identified, this can provide information to help mitigate the potential of the identification system to amplify existing patterns of discrimination.

### Example Scenarios

A human rights impact assessment specifically examines the question of existing patterns of discrimination, and these are addressed in the design and management of the digital legal ID.
