# Access to information by those not involved in managing the system

## Anchor Question #1

Is information about the ID system proactively published eg in an annual report?

### Rights Implications

If disaggregated information about the functioning of the system is published then citizens can monitor the digital ID system which gives opportunities for the government to rectify any human rights violations.

### Example Scenarios

The disaggregated information about the functioning of the system is regulary published via the platform which is accessibly for citizens.

## Anchor Question #2

Is there a right to information law in place?

### Rights Implications

If there is a right to information law in place then citizens can access the information they are entitled to know and better protect individual rights, especially the right to privacy.

### Example Scenarios

Citizens and residents can access information on how the ID system was designed and adopted, and how it is working; civil society and media are able to investigate unfair and corrupt practices in services.This will reduce the risk of human rights violation and exclusion.
