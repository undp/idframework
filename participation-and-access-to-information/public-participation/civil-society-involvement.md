# Civil society involvement

### Anchor Question

Were citizens and civil society consulted on the proposals for digital legal ID; were any changes made as a result?

### Rights Implications

By engaging citizens sufficiently through public dialogue on design of digital legal ID and monitoring framework and taking them into account throughout the process, it increases the transparency and reduces the risk of exclusion and bad design.

### Example Scenarios

There is an inclusive and multi-stakeholder consultative approach to the design of the identity system. The consultative approach is ongoing, and conclusions from the consultation are public, so the results can be assessed against the system design.  There is a public consultation process that is put in place before any proposed change to the policies.  This should be a proactive effort to include users /civil society groups in the design of the system. There has to be an internal audit process with an inter-ministerial steering committee before that.
