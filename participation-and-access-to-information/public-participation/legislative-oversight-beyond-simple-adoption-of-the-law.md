# Legislative oversight (beyond simple adoption of the law)

### Anchor Question

Have the elements of the digital identification system been debated by national legislature and examined by relevant committees; are members of the legislature sufficiently expert in the issues?

### Rights Implications

Strong legislative oversight of the executive is one of the principal ways in which government policy can be reviewed and monitored in the interests of the broader public.

### Example Scenarios

One or more legislative committees is given the mandate to consider legislation establishing the digital legal ID and monitor its implementation in practice. Parliamentarians are given the appropriate training and research support to enable them to understand the implications of different design choices.

### International Standards

SDG Target 16.7: Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.Generally, see resources at the website of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, including 'Global Parliamentary Report 2017â€”Parliamentary oversight: Parliament's power to hold government to account' (IPU and UNDP): [https://www.ipu.org/impact/democracy-and-strong-parliaments/global-parliamentary-report/global-parliamentary-report-2017-parliamentary-oversight-parliaments-power-hold](https://www.ipu.org/impact/democracy-and-strong-parliaments/global-parliamentary-report/global-parliamentary-report-2017-parliamentary-oversight-parliaments-power-hold)
