# Performance guidelines

## Anchor Question #1

Are there performance guidelines? (e.g., a response within x weeks to any application).

### Rights Implications

By using the guidelines, legitimate expectations of those enrolling in the system are established.

### Example Scenarios

If the performance guidelines are established, the regular monitoring and evaluation can track the record and further improve the authorities' and contractors' effort to improve participation and access to information.

### International Standards

## Anchor Question #2

Are all contractors bound by the same rules?

### Rights Implications

When performance standards are applied equally to private sector contractors, they are under the same obligations as the government when it comes to the protection of human rights.

### Example Scenarios

If the performance guidelines are established, the regular monitoring and evaluation can track the record and further improve the authorities' and contractors' effort to improve participation and access to information.
