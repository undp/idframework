# Monitoring impact

### Anchor Question

Do authorities regularly monitor and /or commission evaluation of the performance of the ID system; who has access to these results; are they used to improve the system?

### Rights Implications

If evaluations of the system are regularly conducted and made public, this enables the legislature and civil society to understand the relevant information for its improvement, and gives opportunities to rectify any human rights violations.

### Example Scenarios

Quarterly reviews of the entire digital identity lifecyle is conducted to understand exclusion. Specifically the following should be reviewed:

a. Documents needed,

b. Enrolment points,

c. Time needed to enrol,

d. Days enrolment centre is open,

e. Awareness campaigns on enrolment and data collected,

f. Active targeting outreach to marginalised groups, across the digital divide, groups that may be sceptical of digital ID to build trust.
