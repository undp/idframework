# Welcome to the UNDP Digital ID Framework

The rights-based model governance framework of institutional arrangements based on an expansive architecture of laws, policies, and institutional arrangements will itself be a digital public good (DPG) - freely available as an open-source document and tool hosted in GitHub, with country-specific variations hosted and available as a 'fork' of the model framework.
