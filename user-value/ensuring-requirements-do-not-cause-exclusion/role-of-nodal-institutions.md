# Role of nodal institutions

### Anchor Question

What are the nodal institutions at the sub-national level for implementing the ID program?

### Rights Implications

Decentralisation of identification can allow for local authorities to include known individuals within the identity system, this may increase data security, or ease access to services; however, it may also create opportunities for arbitrary decision-making or significant variability in service quality offered to users.



### Example Scenarios

The nodal institutions at the sub-national level are established and/ or mobile nodal institutions are deployed to bring the services close to the people. The services are provided in compliance with laws, regulations and standards of the operation to avoid arbitrary decision making.

### International Standards
