# Active outreach for enrolment

### Anchor Question

Are government service access points actively used to advertise and ensure awareness of the need to enrol for digital legal ID? (e.g., health points for registration of births and deaths, other services promoting requirement to enrol for digital legal ID in place of existing legal ID).

### Rights Implications

The lack of sufficient public awareness on the need of digital legal ID will lead to exclusion from services.

### Example Scenarios

The public awareness campaigns are conducted through different channels.Multi-lingual approach is used to reach out all the communities.
