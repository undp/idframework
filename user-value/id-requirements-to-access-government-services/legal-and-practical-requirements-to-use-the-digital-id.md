# Legal and practical requirements to use the digital ID

## Anchor Question #1

Access to which government services is enabled by the digital legal ID?Are there services a citizen cannot access without a digital legal ID?

### Rights Implications

Effective use of digital legal ID can enable quicker access to services; however, a requirement for digital legal ID may also create exclusion, if not well regulated.

### Example Scenarios

Each service enabled by the digital legal ID should have exception based handling at all levels leading to accessing the same. The central nodal institution sets up a panel of experts representative of the socioeconomic diversity of the country to design these exception based handling processes. Based on user research and field survey, the panel recommends a list of alternative documents and processes to be put in place for minimising exclusion. The panel also provides governance advice on making sure these alternate processes are not time consuming.These recommendations are enforced by the nodal institution and implemented by the regional bodies. It applies to all public and private institutions delivering the service.The enrolment for digital legal IDs are not limited to biometric enrolment, and have other modalities too. Enrolment should not be a non-negotiable for accessing services linked to the digital legal ID.

### International Standards

Rights established by the ICCPR and ICESCR apply to this entire section: Basic human rights are an entitlement of all, and lack of identification, or the wrong sort of identity document, should not be a barrier. See especially UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. ‘General Comment No. 20: Non-Discrimination in Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Article 2, Para. 2)’. E/C.12/GC/20.

## Anchor Question #2

Are the current procedures leading to any form of targeting, exclusion, or restriction of accessing services linked to digital legal ID?

### Rights Implications

By allowing people to use digital ID and /or physical ID, the government can ensure improved access to services for people (taking into account that a number of people do not have access to the internet, and some may not have digital ID).



## Anchor Question #3

What alternative forms of ID are accepted?

### Rights Implications

By allowing people to use digital ID and /or physical ID, the government can ensure improved access to services for people (taking into account that a number of people do not have access to the internet, and some may not have digital ID).
