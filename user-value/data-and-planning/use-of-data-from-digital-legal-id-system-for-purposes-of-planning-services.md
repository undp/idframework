# Use of data from digital legal ID system for purposes of planning services

### Anchor Question

Is data from the digital legal ID system accessible to relevant agencies to plan services (e.g., number of schools, clinics, police); is the digital legal ID system designed to enable this use?How is data from digital legal ID supplemented with other sources to ascertain the total population, to understand who is not enrolled and plan for services to reach that population?

### Rights Implications

Use of anonymised data from digital ID systems can support national planning for service delivery.

### Example Scenarios

Data from digital legal ID system is cross-referenced with other (survey /census) data on the target population. Coordination with public health function where vital statistics are relevant.Administrative data is used to identify groups and regions that are at risk of exclusion (such as patterns of low coverage of identity documents, or reasons for rejecting an application for an ID).
