# Procurement guidelines define system standards

## Anchor Question

Do procurement guidelines include standards - for example API for data access; data standards for interoperability and system standards to support changing vendors?

## Rights Implications

Open standards for systems, data and API's can strengthen individual control over personal data.

## Example Scenarios

With the introduction of the mechanism that allows interoperability of different systems, different government systems can be linked using the existing assets.

## International Standards
