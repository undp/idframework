# Procedures for procurement of public infrastructure

## Anchor Question

Does the country have established procurement guidelines? Are these suitable for procurement of digital infrastructure?

## Rights Implications

By conducting a fair procurement process, the government is able to ensure the selection of the right product at a satisfactory price point which leads to the responsible usage of the taxpayer's money.

## Example Scenarios

The country's procurement process is in alignment with UN, OECD and WB standards.
