# Expertise

## Anchor Question

Are there staff within the responsible ministry able to evaluate different digital ID systems (including open source solutions) that are on offer? What expert advice is available, or needed, in relation to procurement? What systems are in place to ensure staff members do not engage in unethical practices when evaluating the effectiveness of systems?

## Rights Implications

With the appropriate capacity of acquiring the appropriate solutions, this leads to the reduced cost and sustainability of the legal identity ecosystem.

## Example Scenarios

The nodal institution selects a team of staff drawn from across organization to undertake fact finding visits across countries to learn best practices in the DID space.There is a learning and development team that designs and conducts training to upskill all staff and keep them updated about the recent developments in the space.
