# Extent to which there is an effective anti-corruption legal and institutional framework

## Anchor Question

Is there a national anti-corruption infrastructure in place?

## Rights Implications

See OHCHR corruption and human rights: [https://www.ohchr.org/en/good-governance/corruption-and-human-rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/good-governance/corruption-and-human-rights)

## Example Scenarios

There is a third-party independent audit conducted every year on the nodal institution. The nodal institution and associated regional institutions are accountable to the anti-corruption laws in the country. Each regional institution has to have robust grievance redressal processes and anonymous complaints for corruption (whistle blowing) processes.
