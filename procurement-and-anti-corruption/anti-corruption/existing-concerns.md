# Existing concerns

## Anchor Question #1

Are there specific anti-corruption measures in relation to the digital legal ID?

### Rights Implications

If there are existing allegations of corruption flagged internally or by members of the civil society, more is need to ensure that new processes related to digital legal IDs represent value for taxpayer's money.

### Example Scenarios

There is a third-party independent audit conducted every year on the nodal institution. The nodal institution and associated regional institutions are accountable to the anti-corruption laws in the country. Each regional institution has to have robust grievance redressal processes and anonymous complaints for corruption (whistle blowing) processes.
