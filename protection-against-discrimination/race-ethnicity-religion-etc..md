# Race, ethnicity, religion etc.

## Anchor Question

Do the substantive law and procedures for implementation of the digital legal ID treat members of any religion, ethnic group etc. equally?

## Rights Implications

If the law governing digital legal identity ID elements to mitigate identity-based discrimination, it is less likely to amplify discrimination.

## Example Scenarios

The same evidentiary requirements are established for any person entitled to enroll in the digital legal ID system, without additional requirements being placed on members of certain racial, ethnic, or religious groups.
