# Other status

## Anchor Question

Are any other categories of person affected by discrimination in relation to the digital ID?

## Rights Implications

In a large number of countries, lack of legal identity especially affects poor people living in urban slums or remote rural regions; other affected categories could be, for example, children of sex workers.

## Example Scenarios

A human rights impact assessment considers such excluded populations and specific outreach attempts are made to engage them.
