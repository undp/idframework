## Anchor Question

Are there legal provisions and practical arrangements that accommodate people with different forms of disability?

## Rights Implications

When the international standard to include people with disabilities or other challenges is met, it ensures their inclusion in digital ID systems.

The legislation establishing the digital legal ID system envisages special measures to ensure that people with disabilities of different types can enroll in the system and use their digital legal ID.
