# Prevention and reduction of statelessness

## Anchor Question

If the digital legal ID is proof of legal status in the country, are the basic protections against statelessness in place in national law, notably (a) presumption of nationality for children of unknown parents found in the territory; (b) granting of nationality to children born in the country who cannot acquire the nationality of a parent (because the parent is stateless, of unknown nationality, or cannot transmit nationality to a child under the laws of the country of origin of the parent)?

## Rights Implications

Statelessness is a major cause of exclusion and poverty.

## Example Scenarios

National legislation establishing the rules for acquisition of nationality establishes the basic protections against statelessness required by international law, and these are where relevant, also reflected in civil registration and family law.
