# Access to proof of identity for all

## Anchor Question

How are existing systems for refugee status and stateless person determination integrated into the digital legal ID?

## Rights Implications

If a person is officially recognised as a refugee or stateless, such persons should have access to digital legal ID in the same format as citizens so they can access rights and entitlements.

## Example Scenarios

The digital legal ID law should adhere to UNHCR standards laid out for the identification and protection of refugees and stateless persons.
