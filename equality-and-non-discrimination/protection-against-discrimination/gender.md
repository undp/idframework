# Gender

## Anchor Questions

* Do the substantive law and procedures for implementation of the digital legal ID treat women and men equally? (e.g., women do not need to ask their male head of household to obtain ID?).
* Are there measures in place to ensure that people are not excluded from registration based on sex or gender identity (e.g., LGBTI - provisions for change of name, identity; those checking identity generally only have access to current identity elements).

## Rights Implications

If there are measures in place, digital legal ID systems can mitigate existing patterns of gender and identity based discrimination.

## Example Scenarios

The laws establishing the digital legal ID enable enrolment without discrimination based on sex or gender, and provide a procedures for those whose gender identity has changed to be able to adjust their records.
