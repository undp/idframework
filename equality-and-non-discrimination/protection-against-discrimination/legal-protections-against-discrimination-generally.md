# Legal protections against discrimination generally

## Anchor Question

What protections are there in the constitution or other laws against discrimination and abuse of rights? Are there any exclusions (e.g., customary /religious law)?

## Rights Implications

If a general constitutional or statutory framework for non-discrimination is in place, it provides a basis for users to challenge discrimination in the operation of a digital legal ID system.

## Example Scenarios

The institution managing the digital legal ID system clearly states (online, and in its offices) the laws and institutions citizens can seek protection within if their rights are infringed and they are discriminated against - and the procedures to do so (see heading on accountability and the rule of law). The DID laws do not discriminate across genders, race, ethnicity, etc., treating them all equally. There are no liabilities to enrol or access services linked to DID because of gender.

## International Standards

The framework of international human rights treaties & interpretation by treaty bodies.See especially UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. ‘General Comment No. 20: Non-Discrimination in Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Article 2, Para. 2)’.
