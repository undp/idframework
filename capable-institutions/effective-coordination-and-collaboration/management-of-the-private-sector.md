# Management of the private sector

## Anchor Question

If the design and management of the digital ID system is contracted to the private sector, are the responsibilities and authority of the private sector actors clear and publicly known? Is it clear which government agency is responsible for giving direction to a private sector partner and holding it to account?

## Rights Implications

If the agencies responsible for ID have the skills and resources to commission digital legal ID systems, these systems are more likely to be responsive to public needs ensuring sustainability of such systems, if a government is able to choose the most appropriate products at a satisfactory price point, this also leads to the responsible usage of tax.

## Example Scenarios

The roles and responsibilities of all participating teams and institutions are clearly displayed digitally, and made available on other forums as well. Whenever a new contractor or an institution is onboarded onto the ecosystem, they are also included in such a system.
