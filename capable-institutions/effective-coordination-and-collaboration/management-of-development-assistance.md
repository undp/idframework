# Management of development assistance

## Anchor Question

If the implementation of digital legal ID systems is supported by development assistance, which ministry is responsible for coordinating the support of different development agencies?Do development agencies involved in supporting digital legal ID systems coordinate themselves in order to reduce transaction costs for state agencies?

## Rights Implications

Multiple initiatives supported by different agencies can result in overlapping projects and wasted costs. Coordination by the government and between the agencies themselves can help to ensure that common objectives are supported.

## Example Scenarios

Development agencies regularly meet to ensure duplication is avoided; the government task force appoints a focal point for coordination of engagement with development partners.
