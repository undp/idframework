# Coordination mechanisms between identity authority and other government entities

## Anchor Question

What systems exist for the coordination of initiatives in relation to digital legal ID among different ministries and agencies? (e.g., formal (e.g., MOU) or informal arrangements (e.g., regular meetings, joint programmes); advisory /coordination committee).

## Rights Implications

An effective coordination mechanism enhances the interoperability and integration of different systems, which increases the efficiency of public service delivery and providing increased access to services.

## Example Scenarios

The government appoints a task force or other mechanism to coordinate identification initiatives.
