# Independence of agency managing identification

## Anchor Question

To what extent is day to day management of the digital legal ID system independent of political interference? Is there a separate identity agency for the management of the digital legal ID? If not, does the department or agency in charge of the system have operational independence within the framework of the law establishing the digital legal ID system, including the appointment and removal of the director of the relevant entity? &#x20;



## Rights Implications

An independent agency, independent of the executive, is more likely to operate impartially ; since electoral registration often depends on access to a national foundational ID, the same principles should apply to identity management. However, the creation of a new agency may also make coordination more difficult, and should be undertaken with care. There should be operational independence of the agency, and freedom from direct interference by ministers in individual decision-making on enrolment or status within the ID system, including security of tenure of the director of the relevant entity.

## Example Scenarios

There are two general categories of good practices, depending on national context: (a) the digital legal ID is fully managed by an independent agency;(b) a government agency or department manages the digital legal ID, with operational independence, which is overseen by an independent agency (see further, heading on accountability and the rule of law).
