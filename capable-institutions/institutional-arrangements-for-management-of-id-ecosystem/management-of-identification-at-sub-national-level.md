# Management of identification at sub-national level

## Anchor Question

Are the responsibilities of the nodal institutions at the sub-national level implementing the digital legal ID program clearly established in primary or secondary legislation, or other publicly available official document? What are the rights of individuals to register for the digital legal ID at any convenient enrolment site?

## Rights Implications

Decentralisation of identification can allow for local authorities to include known individuals within the identity system, it may increase data security, or ease access to services; however, it may also create opportunities for arbitrary decision-making.Providing the option to enrol at multiple sites (rather than establishing geographic constraints) can help limit the impacts of local discrimination through the discretion of agents.

## Example Scenarios

The responsibilities of the nodal institutions at the sub-national level implementing the digital legal ID program are clearly established in primary or secondary legislation, or other publicly available official documentation. The rights of individuals to register for the digital legal ID at any convenient enrolment site are articulated and publicised.
