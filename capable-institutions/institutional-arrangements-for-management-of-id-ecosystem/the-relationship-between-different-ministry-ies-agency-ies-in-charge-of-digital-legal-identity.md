# The relationship between different ministry(ies) /agency(ies) in charge of digital legal identity

## Anchor Question #1

Are the responsibilities and authority of the different ministry(ies) or department(s) that are ultimately responsible for the management of digital legal ID clearly established in law? Is the relationship between the different entities clear?

### Rights Implications

The clear demarcation of the role clarifies where the responsibilities and priorities lie in the case of mismanagement of the digital legal ID system or the personal data of the population.Civil society and the general public should know which agency is responsible for what aspects of the digital legal ID system.

### Example Scenarios

The responsibilities and authority of the different ministry(ies) or department(s) who are ultimately responsible for the management of digital legal ID are clearly established in law, and the relationships between the different entities is clear. The law is publicised, and the public are aware of the roles and responsibilities of each agency in relation to the identity system.

Principle 9: "Institutional mandates: Legislation, regulation, and trust frameworks must establish and regulate comprehensive governance arrangements for identification systems and providers domestically and—if applicable—internationally. This should include specifying the terms and conditions governing the institutional relations among participating parties, so that the rights and responsibilities of each are clear to all. Accountability: There should be clear accountability and transparency around the roles and responsibilities of all entities involved in building, operating, managing, and overseeing identification systems."David Eaves from the 2018 State of Digital Transformation Report, 'Proposing A Maturity Model for Digital Services' (2018): [https://medium.com/digitalhks/part-2-proposing-a-maturity-model-for-digital-services-9b1d429699e7](https://medium.com/digitalhks/part-2-proposing-a-maturity-model-for-digital-services-9b1d429699e7)



## Anchor Question #2

Is there a publicly available official document establishing the priorities and goals of the digital legal ID system under consideration?

### Rights Implications

Priorities for ID systems are likely to be different for different ministries for whom identification is relevant - for example an emphasis on security, welfare or legal status. A clear statement of the overall objectives of the system enables parliamentary and public oversight of its implementation.

### Example Scenarios

There is a publicly available and publicised description of the purpose, goals and priorities of the ID system. Parliament and the public are aware of these and they are able to reference them in their oversight of the ID system.
