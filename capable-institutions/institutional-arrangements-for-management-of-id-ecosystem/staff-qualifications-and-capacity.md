# Staff qualifications and capacity

## Anchor Question

What qualifications or training do staff have to understand and use the digital ID system, across different uses in government? What steps are taken to ensure there is adequate capacity? What technical documentation is available? what technical capacity is there to support integration? What investment is there in the user experience/provision of the identity tool as a service? Return again to the purpose of digital identity is for it to be used and therefore how far does this management capacity extend to client management/active increase in terms of the Total Addressable Market?

## Rights Implications

Well trained staff - including 'last-mile' authorities - improves the accuracy, transparency, and efficiency of the identity management system as well as public service delivery.

## Example Scenarios

There is a strategy for skills training and staff retention. In case of private sector involvement in design and management of the system, there is a strategy for skills transfer.
