# Rules on data sharing â€“ information exchange

## Anchor Question #1

Are there any laws for cross border data exchanges?

## Anchor Question #2

What are the service agreements in place to exchange data with other public or private institutions?

## Anchor Question #3

Is the country part of a regional data privacy framework that ensures adequacy standards for personal data transfer outside the region?

## Anchor Question #4

Is there a mechanism for periodic oversight of adequacy measures in all participating countries?

### Rights Implications

With the dispute resolution mechanism in place and well communicated, people are able to access justice in case of mismanagement or abuse of personal data especially when the international data transaction is involved.

### Example Scenarios

The country can be part of a regional data privacy framework as long as the technical standards defined by its nodal institution are met, and there is an alignment of legal principles.In the absence of the same, the data privacy law and technical standards should cover processes and liabilities of international data exchanges.
