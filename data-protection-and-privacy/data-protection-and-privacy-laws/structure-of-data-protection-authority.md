# Structure of data protection authority

## Anchor Question #1

Does the country have an independent data protection authority?

### Rights Implications

With the legal and governance framework of data protection, the risk of unauthorized and unsafe use of a people's data by various actors for their benefit will be significantly lower.

### Example Scenarios

There is an independent data protection authority with a legal mandate, financial resources and political independence to carry out its obligations and responsibilities.

## Anchor Question #2

Is the law operational and enforced?

### Rights Implications

With the enforced and operational law, the risk of misue and/or breach of personal information will be significantly lower.

### Example Scenarios

The law mandating the data protection authority is operational and enforced. Extenuating circumstances (such as delays between enactment and implementation) are covered by agreed procedures that ensure continuity of legal protection and mandate. If a data protection law has been passed but not enforced (possibly due to a transitionary period for data custodians), the government may opt to remove this period from the operations of identity authority.&#x20;
