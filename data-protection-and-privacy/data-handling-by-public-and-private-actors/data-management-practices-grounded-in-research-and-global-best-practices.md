# Data management practices grounded in research and global best practices

## Anchor Question #1

What is the best practice for data storage and handling? (e.g., centralised, decentralised, federated?)   How protected is the citizen's data? What are the risks if there is a breach?

### Rights Implications

With the appropriate data protection and data management practices based on international best practices and research, the risk of unauthorised and unsafe use of a people's data by various actors for their benefit will be significantly lower.

### Example Scenarios

Data management policies and guidelines reflect international best practice, including practices and recommendations for data ownership and oversight.The appropriate access control and its oversight mechanism is in place to ensure that the access to such data by the legitimate actors is limited for specific purposes only.

### International Standards

## Anchor Question #2

Who owns, manages and stores ID? (If the security sector is the main agency to own, manage and store ID, is there a comprehensive mechanism that limits the usage of the data for specific purposes only?)

### Rights Implications

With the appropriate data protection and data management practices based on international best practices and research, the risk of unauthorised and unsafe use of a people's data by various actors for their benefit will be significantly lower.
