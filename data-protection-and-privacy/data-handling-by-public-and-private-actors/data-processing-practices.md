# Data processing practices

## Anchor Question #1

Are there any policies that require the collection and handling of data to be based on principles of data minimisation, being proportionate, and for a specific purpose?

## Anchor Question #2

How long will data be stored, and what are the procedures for deleting data?

## Anchor Question #3

What is the role of the individual's rights and consent in any form of processing data?

## Anchor Question #4

Are the purposes of processing data, along with its parameters, and the need for the same available in the public domain? Have there been consultations on the same?

### Rights Implications

Data processing forms the core of data handling and protection. Consent should be central to all data processing activities, and principles of data minimisation and proportionality will ensure that there is a minimum of personal data collected about an individual.

### Example Scenarios

Data processing policies and guidelines reflect international best practice, including and recommendations for data processing and oversight. Consent from the data subject is obtained throughout data processing activities and principles of data minimization and proportionality applies.
